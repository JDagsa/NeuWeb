## About NeuWeb
### What is NeuWeb?
NeuWeb is an open-source browser I'm building. It is based on the Apple WebKit engine.
### What devices will NeuWeb support?
Currently, NeuWeb only supports iOS devices and Macs, but if I have someone who can develop  
for Linux devices (since there is a WebKit build for Linux), then Linux will be supported.  
For Windows however, I don't currently know if there is a build of WebKit for Windows, but until then, no Windows support.
### Why did you choose WebKit over Chromium?
Well, even if they are similar, WebKit makes it easier for me as a developer to develop a secure browsing experience,  
while at the same time, making everything seamless and smooth. I also prefer WebKit for its focus on privacy, unlike  
Chromium, which Google built to track people and what they do on the Internet. 
### How can I support or contribute to NeuWeb's development?
If you want to support the project, just find the "Sponsor this project" section in the right-hand corner.  
If you want to contribute code to NeuWeb, just send me a message on Twitter (@jdagsa.tweet), and I'll give you commit access.
### What license is the source code of NeuWeb licensed under?
NeuWeb is licensed under the MIT License. The WebKit framework is licensed under the LGPL and BSD licenses respectively.
